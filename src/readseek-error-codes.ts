/**
 * READSEEK error code taxonomy — single source of truth.
 *
 * Every error returned via `readseekValue.error.code` MUST be a key in this map.
 * To add a new error: extend this object with a kebab-case code, a one-line
 * description, and the trigger condition. Codes are stable: renaming is a
 * breaking change for downstream consumers.
 *
 * Distinction:
 * - errors (this file): fatal — the tool could not produce its primary result.
 * - warnings (ReadseekWarning): non-fatal — the tool produced a result but flagged
 *   something the agent should know.
